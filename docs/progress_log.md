## After 04-12-2025

### Work done
- research into:
    - PCA: preserve global variance ...
    - UMAP / t-SNE: preserve local neighborhoods ...
    - TorchDR: same math goal as PCA but is incremental and GPU-based

### Next steps
- studying the influence of these methods on the apperance of the structure, interpreting the result and verfiying its reproducibilty
